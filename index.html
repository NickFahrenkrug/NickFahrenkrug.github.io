      Biography
    </h1>
<p>
Baritone Nicholas Fahrenkrug has been sought after throughout the east coast for his burnished sound and thoughtful story-telling across a broad range of challenging repertoire. Fahrenkrug returns to Boston from a recent residency with Seagle Festival where he served as a teaching artist touring a new children’s opera by Evan Mack, as well as a revue featuring one hundred years of Disney music. This season he has been featured with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra in Don Carlos, as well as Boston Opera Collaborative’s Opera Inferno. He has appeared in the chorus with Boston Lyric Opera in Aida, and Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Holiday Pops. Fahrenkrug recently originated the role of James Duffy in Richard Wargo’s newest opera, At That Hour, a commemoration of the great soprano Marcella Sembrich at her studio in Lake George, NY. Fahrenkrug also frequently performs experimental choral music with Nightingale Vocal Ensemble. Notable roles include Hawkins Fuller (Fellow Travelers), Guglielmo (Così fan tutte), Giulio Cesare (Giulio Cesare), Conte Almaviva (Le nozze di Figaro), Harlekin (Ariadne auf Naxos), Raimbaud (Le comte Ory), and John Buchanan (Summer and Smoke). Nicholas is a proud alum of Louisiana State University (MM) and Lawrence Conservatory of Music (BM).

    <b>VOICES OF WATER | March 12, Shalin Liu Performance Center, Rockport, MA | March 14, Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston, MA | March 15, Cape Cod (TBD) </b>
    <p>
        Nicholas Fahrenkrug joins Nightingale Vocal Ensemble in VOICES OF WATER.
<p>
  "In the spirit of Nightingale's October performance exploring the development of Massachusetts' Quabbin Reservoir, the 'Gales turn their attention to the rest of the State's water-shaped history. Beginning with the creation of Cape Cod and the Islands as told by Massachusetts' indigenous communities, Nightingale also explores the geological formation before examining other important moments. The first Europeans from across the ocean to the waves of Irish immigration to Boston, the vast whaling and fishing industries that shaped local economies, and even present day ecological politics that will inform the Bay State's future -- all of these and more come together to create a rich musical representation of our beloved New England home."

    <b>LYSISTRATA | February 15, 2025 | Jordan Hall, New England Conservatory, Boston, MA </b>
    <p>
      Nicholas Fahrenkrug performs the role of Second Geezer/Philo in Odyssey Opera's production of <em>Lysistrata</em>, under the direction of Gil Rose and Mark Adamo.
<p>
  "In 2005, composer-librettist Mark Adamo—fresh off his first opera, Little Women—freely adapted, for his second, Aristophanes’s Lysistrata, the comedy about the women of Athens and Sparta who, disgusted by a pointless war, barricade themselves in the Athenian treasury and swear a sanction on sex until their men make peace. “Freely” is the key word here: the composer “…cut all but three scenes of the play, created new male characters, changed the war, and invented a wrangling romance between Lysistrata and the Athenian leader Nico. The opera imagines a woman who, at first, fakes political convictions so as to wreak on her lover an emotional revenge: only later must she ask herself, to whom does she belong, herself or her people? And its score sends its melodies searching through a labyrinth of mirrors; no sooner is a theme sung by one character, given one meaning, than it is assumed by someone else and inflected with quite another. The libretto suggests, ‘Each of you will tell the truth; neither will agree.’ The score aims to make that suggestion an audible process.” Of its celebrated 2005 premiere, Alex Ross, in The New Yorker, wrote “It’s shocking how deep this seemingly lighthearted opera goes.” Twenty years after that debut, Gil Rose conducts and the composer directs an internationally accomplished cast in Boston’s first-ever staging of Lysistrata, to be recorded for release on CD by Pentatone.""

      <p>
        Awarded by the American Prize in Opera Performance for my art film “Dichterliebe: Within and Without” in 2021, this guerilla style video cycle was inspired by the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
      I was unsatisfied with the idea of performing a degree recital to an empty room. The time, if you can imagine it, was before livestreaming was common practice. I wanted to create a space where my audience could interact with the piece without feeling that “it would’ve been better in person.” This project was the first time I ever worked with the digital medium and I am eager to produce more with it.
