    </p>

<p>
I perform new music, opera, song, early music, musical theater, cabaret, and in choral ensembles. I am especially interested in new works, Deep Listening, experimental performance and improvisation, and digital visualizations.
</p>

<p>
I am cofounder of the piano/voice duo, Apollo Duo, alongside my colleague and dear friend, pianist Eleonora Apostolidi. I enjoy producing and exploring experimental visualizations set to music.

        Awarded by the American Prize in Opera Performance for my art film “Dichterliebe: Within and Without” in 2021, this guerilla style video cycle was inspired by the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak.

      <p>
      I was unsatisfied with the idea of performing a degree recital to an empty room. The time, if you can imagine it, was before livestreaming was common practice. I wanted to create a space where my audience could interact with the piece without feeling that “it would’ve been better in person.” This project was the first time I ever worked with the digital medium and I am eager to produce more with it.
