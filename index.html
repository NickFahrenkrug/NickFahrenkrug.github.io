The members of Nightingale Vocal Ensemble will use all of their compositional, vocal, and dramatic capabilities to celebrate—and expand—the unique capacity for an ensemble to tell a story.”

“Created by O-Lan Jones and Emmett Tinley, <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> is a contemporary love story enmeshed in the mythic world of Iceland. Vala falls off the map of the known world into the Dark Night of the Soul. Mundi, who has just met her at the airport, but feels an intense connection, goes to find her in the wilderness. They are helped by the Hiddenfolk, supernatural beings in a parallel world, who wish ardently for humans to find love because when people are in love they remember there is a Hidden World and connection between the two worlds opens. The Hiddenfolk evoke the Bird, The Bull, The Giant and The Dragon as needed to help the lovers in their quest.”

<b>March 30, April 1, April 3, 2023 | Virtual Performance</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam makes her company debut with White Snake Projects in <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span>, a virtual opera experience.
</p>

<p>
“An operatic response to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> also reflects WSP’s continuing commitment to the live socially distant streaming performance model it developed with such success in the early stages of the pandemic…Underlying the theme of <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> is that even the term ‘Asian American’ is a social and political construct, completely missing the kaleidoscope of cultures and politics of the 20 different ethnic groups that are encompassed under that umbrella, groups that are geographically spread over more than half the land mass of the Earth. The production features music by Benjamin Kono, Randall Eng, Nilo Alcala, Liliya Ugay, and Shirish Korde, who along with their writer partners – Cerise Jacobs, Monique Truong, Deepali Gupta, Sokunthary Svay and Xu Xi – create operatic scenes of Asian Americans establishing themselves in the United States.”

“Love in the air - and in the glass! When Nemorino, a bashful bus boy, has his heart set on Adina, a vivacious bar owner, it’s going to take more than dogged persistence to win her over. Fortunately, a traveling liquor salesman has just the thing - a pheromone-laden brew that’s guaranteed to turn heads and hearts. But will the potion work before Adina’s is swept off her feet by a dashing soldier?”

When Sweeney reunites with the devious Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a failing meat pie shop, they hatch a plan that will help her with her business struggles and satisfy his hunger for revenge.”
