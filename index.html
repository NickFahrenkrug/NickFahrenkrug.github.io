      Biography
    </h1>
<p>
Baritone Nicholas Fahrenkrug has been sought after throughout the east coast for his burnished sound and thoughtful story-telling across a broad range of challenging repertoire. Fahrenkrug returns to Boston from a recent residency with Seagle Festival where he served as a teaching artist touring a new children’s opera by Evan Mack, as well as a revue featuring one hundred years of Disney music. This season he has been featured with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra in Don Carlos, as well as Boston Opera Collaborative’s Opera Inferno. He has appeared in the chorus with Boston Lyric Opera in Aida, and Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Holiday Pops. Fahrenkrug recently originated the role of James Duffy in Richard Wargo’s newest opera, At That Hour, a commemoration of the great soprano Marcella Sembrich at her studio in Lake George, NY. Fahrenkrug also frequently performs experimental choral music with Nightingale Vocal Ensemble. Notable roles include Hawkins Fuller (Fellow Travelers), Guglielmo (Così fan tutte), Giulio Cesare (Giulio Cesare), Conte Almaviva (Le nozze di Figaro), Harlekin (Ariadne auf Naxos), Raimbaud (Le comte Ory), and John Buchanan (Summer and Smoke). Nicholas is a proud alum of Louisiana State University (MM) and Lawrence Conservatory of Music (BM).

      <p>
        Awarded by the American Prize in Opera Performance for my art film “Dichterliebe: Within and Without” in 2021, this guerilla style video cycle was inspired by the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
      I was unsatisfied with the idea of performing a degree recital to an empty room. The time, if you can imagine it, was before livestreaming was common practice. I wanted to create a space where my audience could interact with the piece without feeling that “it would’ve been better in person.” This project was the first time I ever worked with the digital medium and I am eager to produce more with it.
